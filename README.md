Hi, I'm Roberto Ibarra, a self taught web developer located in Baja California, Mexico. I'm currently studying Mechatronics Engineering in Cetys Universidad.
My two big passions are to create products that can improve the life quality of people and the creation of beautiful and intuitives UI's. 
With these passions put together and with a little help from programming, I'm able to create software products that are aesthetically beautiful(At least for me).
My current stack is mainly NodeJs, Express, Mysql and a little bit of React.
